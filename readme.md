# Notes App

Simple app to add and edit notes. Created to learn and improve React.js skills.

## Getting Started

1. You need to have meteor installed on your machine to get started
- Intall instructions
[https://www.meteor.com/install](https://www.meteor.com/install)

2. Git clone the project and cd into it.

3. Run the following commands to install the node packages and start the server

```
	npm install
```

``` 
	meteor run 
```

## Testing

In this project I am using 
- [Mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/) - a testing framework running on Node.js
- [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/) - a testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.
- [Expect.js](https://github.com/mjackson/expect) - an assertion library

To run tests:
```
	npm test
```
And go to localhost:3000
